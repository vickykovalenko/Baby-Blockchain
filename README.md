My implementation of blockchain for a digital identity system.
### Task:
Implement your own blockchain for a digital identity system.
### Description:
* Provide identification.
* The user can register and verify their data and hide their identity to prevent data theft.
* Digital identities must be encrypted.
* Users can store contact information, such as current phone number or bitcoin address.
* All digital identity events are publicly available, while user data is stored in a separate secure database, the contents of which are distributed among individual providers.
* The user provides data only those personal data that are necessary for verification and does not disclose others.
